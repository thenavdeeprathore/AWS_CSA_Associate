# RDS is a Traditional databases (OLTP) - tables with rows and columns

# Relational Databases (RDS) on AWS:
1) SQL Server
2) Oracle
3) MySQL Server
4) PostgreSQL
5) Aurora {Serverless}
6) MariaDB

# RDS has two key features:
=> Multi-AZ : for disaster recovery
    Multi-AZ is available for the following databases: 
        - MySQL
        - MariaDB
        - PostgreSQL
        - Oracle
        - Microsoft SQL Server

    Amazon Aurora is by default fault tolerant

=> Read Replicas : for performance
    Allows you to have a read-only copy of your production database
    Used for scaling, not for disaster recovery
    Achieved by using Asynchronous Replication from the primary RDS instance to the read replicas
    Must have automated backups turned on to deploy a read replica
    You can have upto 5 read replica copies of any database
    Each read replica will have its own DNS endpoint
    You can have read replicas that have Multi-AZ
    You can have read replicas in a different region
    Read Replicas is available for the following databases: 
        - MySQL
        - MariaDB
        - PostgreSQL
        - Oracle
        - Amazon Aurora


# AWS Management Console --> Database --> RDS
1) Create database
2) Engine options
    - Amazon Aurora
    - MySQL
    - MariaDB
    - PostgreSQL
    - Oracle
    - Microsoft SQL Server
3) Engine option selected - MySQL
4) Versions - Select MySQL version
5) Select Templates
    - Production
    - Dev/Test
    - Free Tier
6) DB instance identifier - navdeepdatabase
7) Master username - admin
8) Master password - admin123
9) DB instance size - Burstable classes - db t2.micro Not EBS optimized
10) Allocated storage - 20 GB
11) Enable storage autosclaing
12) Max storage threshold - 1000
13) Additional configuration - initial database name - navdeepdatabase
14) Backup retention period - 0 days
15) Select Maintenance window
16) Enable deletion protection


# Backups with RDS
# There are two different types of RDS backups
1) Automated backups
    - This is enabled by default
    - The backup data is stored in S3
    - If you have RDS instance of 10 GB, you will get 10 GB worth of storage free
2) Database snapshots
    - Done manually (they are user initiated)
    - They are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance, unlike automated backups
=> Restored version of the database will be a new RDS instance with a new DNS endpoint
# Encryption at rest
=> Encryption is done using the AWS KMS service.
=> Once your RDS instance is encrypted, the data stored at rest in the underlying storage is encrypted, 
    as are its automated backups, read replicas, and snapshots.


# Important Pointers on RDS:
=> RDS runs on virtual machines which users doesn't have access to
=> Security, patching, maintenance is managed by AWS for RDS
=> RDS is NOT serverless
=> Amazon Aurora is however serverless but RDS is not serverless
=> RDS Reserved instances are available for multi-AZ deployments
=> With new RDS DB instances, automated backups are enabled by default
=> In RDS, maximum value I can set for my backup retention period is 35 days
=> How many copies of my data does RDS â€“ Aurora store by default - 6
=> MySQL installations default to port number - 3306
=> If you want your application to check RDS for an error, have it look for an ______ node in the response from the Amazon RDS API - Error node
=> What data transfer charge is incurred when replicating data from your primary RDS instance to your secondary RDS instance - No charges
=> Under what circumstances would I choose provisioned IOPS over standard storage when creating an RDS instance? - If you using online transaction processing in your production environment
=> If you are using Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS storage with a Microsoft SQL Server database engine, what is the maximum size RDS volume you can have by default? - 16 TB
=> In RDS, changes to the backup window take effect - Immediately
=> Technically a destination port number is needed, however with a DB security group the RDS instance port number is automatically applied to the RDS DB Security Group
=> When you add a rule to an RDS DB security group, you must specify a port number or protocol. - FALSE
